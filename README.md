# 🛠️ Lawn Mower DIY Project

A self-designed and self-built DIY lawn mower project intended for mowing grass in a backyard or garden. The goal is to create a practical device with the potential for both automatic control (GPS RTK) and manual operation (remote control).

## 🎯 Project Goal

Design and build a functional lawn mower that is:
- Manually controlled (RC) or autonomous (GPS RTK)
- Electrically powered
- Modular and expandable

## ⚙️ Mower Type

- **Cutting system:** Rotary mower (spinning blade)
- **Power source:** Electric (battery-powered)
- **Control:** Manual or remote-controlled

## 🔋 Power Supply

- Voltage: 12–24 V DC
- Battery type: Li-Ion / LiFePO4
- Runtime: 30–45 minutes

## 🚜 Drive System

- Drive: 2WD (front wheels)
- Motors: DC with gearbox / stepper motors
- Speed control: PWM with H-bridge drivers
- Speed: 0.3–0.6 m/s

## 🛠️ Cutting System

- Blade: Disc with replaceable cutting edges
- Cutting motor: BLDC ~100–300 W or brushed DC motor
- Cutting width: 10–30 cm
- Cutting height: Adjustable

## 📐 Dimensions and Weight

- Working width: 40–50 cm
- Length: up to ? cm
- Height: ? cm
- Weight: max ? kg (including batteries)

## 🧠 Control and Automation

- Microcontroller: Arduino / STM
- Sensors:
  - Obstacle detection (IR, ultrasonic)
  - Positioning (compass, GPS)
  - Speed monitoring (encoders)
- Safety features:
  - Emergency stop switch
  - Tilt sensor
  - Motor thermal protection

## 🧱 Mechanical Construction

- Frame: Steel or aluminum profile
- Housing: Plastic or metal
- Wheels: 15–25 cm in diameter
- Height adjustment mechanism: Manual or servo-driven

## 💰 Budget

- Estimated cost: 500–1500 PLN (~100–350 EUR)
